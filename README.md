# jQuery-RPG-Game
Homework 4, jQuery Homework. A working RPG game with stats and player choices. 

I learned SO MUCH doing this project. The biggest thing I learned was how to use session storage and save variable values across HTML pages. Further more, I learned how to use downloaded jQuery plugins. I learned various others too, popovers, jQuery hover actions, ect.
